This file contains the relevant features of the language (currently it is only a small subset of Core language).

###  Characters  ###
A Core program is written in UTF-8 encoding.
In the code only some of ASCII characters might be used:
a-zA-Z0-9_+-*/%=<>|&!:;,(){}"
As well as spaces and new lines (those can be non-ASCII as well).
All the UTF-8 symbols are allowed in string literals.

###  Comments  ###
In any place within the program (apart from within string literals) it is allowed to write comments.
There can be comments of 2 types:
1) Single-line comments //<any characters>[<new line>]
2) Multiline comments /*<any characters>|<nested comments>*/
It is allowed to have nested multiline comments.
Single-line comments might include the /* character combination, it wouldn't cause a multiline comment.
All the comments are ingored by compiler and do not affect the token stream (apart from the new lines within).

###  Program structure  ###
A program consists of a single .core file.
The file can contain a number of functions, among which there must be the main function.
<program> :=
	<declaration>...
<declaration> :=
	<function-declaration>
	|<variable-declaration>

###  Function declaration  ###
TO declare a function, one must use the following syntax:
<function> :=
	fn <name>([<argument-name>: <type>[, other arguments...]])[: <return-type>] [<function-body>]|[= native("<extern-function-name>")]
<function-body> :=
	= <expression>
	|<scope>
<scope> :=
	{ [<statement>]... }

Function name and arguments must be valid identifiers.
Function can have no or any number of arguments.
If function return type is not specified explicitly, then it will be unit type (unless the = <expression> 
is used as a function body, then the return type can be inferred).
One can use = native("<extern-function-name>") instead of body to state that the function is external and 
will be linked to the program later.
Example: fn putc(ch: i32): i32 = native("putc")
This allows to deal with mangling.
Function body can be written as either a code scope {...} or assignment = ...
Assignment like this fn <name>(<args>): <return-type> = <expression>
is equivalent to: fn <name>(<argg>): <return-type> { return expression }

###  Statements  ###
Within a code scope there can be one of those three statements:
<statement> :=
	<function> # Internal function declaration
	|let <variable-name>[: <variable-type>] = <expression> # Variable declaration
	|<scope>
	|<expression>
It is possible to explicitly separate statements with semicolon,
otherwise statements must be separated with a new line.

###  Variable declaration  ###
let <variable-name>[: <variable-type>] = <expression>
With the syntax demonstrated above, one can declare a local variable on the stack.
Such a variable will only exist within the scope.
Also, it is allowed to do shadowing, thus overriding an existing variable with another of the same name.

###  Types  ###
<type> :=
	i8|i16|i32|i64|i128|u8|u16|u32|u64|u128|cint|clong|cuint|culong|bool|unit.
bool is the boolean type with 2 possible values: true and false.
unit is the type of no value, it can only be used as the return type of a function.
cint, clong, cuint, culong are C-compatible types. Their size can vary depending on the target.

When a number literal is used, its type can be inquired from context if it is stated in the parent expression:
let a: u64 = 0 // Will be of u64 type
fn f(x: i8)...
f(12) // Will be of i8 type

###  Expressions  ###
There are following expressions available:
<expression> :=
	return <expression> # Returns the expression result from the function. Has the never type. Cannot be used in another return statement.
	|<comparative>
<logical> :=
	<comparative> || <logical>
	|<comparative> && <logical>
	|<comparative>
<comparative> :=
	<additive> == <comparative>
	|<additive> != <comparative>
	|<additive> <= <comparative>
	|<additive> >= <comparative>
	|<additive> < <comparative>
	|<additive> > <comparative>
	|<additive>
<additive> :=
	<multiplicative> + <additive>
	|<multiplicative> - <additive>
	|<multiplicative>
<multiplicative> :=
	<convertive> * <multiplicative>
	|<convertive> / <multiplicative>
	|<convertive> % <multiplicative>
	|<convertive>
<convertive> :=
	<convertive> as <type>
	|<unary>
<unary> :=
	+<unary>
	|-<unary>
	|!<unary>
	|<postprimary>
<postprimary> :=
	<postprimary>([<expression>[, <expression>]...])
	|<primary>
<primary> :=
	(<expression>)
	|<identifier>
	|<literal>
Conditional expressions may be chained: a < b < c is the same as a < b && b < c.

Expressions where all the parts are literals are guaranteed to be computed at compile time.

###  Type convertions  ###
It is disallowed to have implicit type convertions in Core.
To make a type conversion explicitly, one must use the as operator.
Convertion rules:
Integer types are convertible to other integer types.
Bool and function pointers are convertible to integers.
Integers are convertible to function pointer.

###  Literals  ###
There are currently only two type of literals: numbers and strings.
<literal> := <number>|<text>
<number> :=
	[<numeric-system>]<number>
<numeric-system> :=
	0x|0o|0b
<number> :=
	<digit>[<digit>|']
<digit> :=
	0-9
<text> :=
	[r]"<characters without new line>..." # Single line string
	|[r]"""<characters with possibly new line>...""" # Multiline string
r before the string literal stands for raw string, where all the characters are understood as is, whereas in
common strings there can be escape sequences:
	\n, \t, \v, \f, \e, \a, \b, \', \", \\, \{, \}, \r, \[o]<octal value>, \o{...}, \x<hexadecimal value>, \x{...}, \uDDDD, \u{<unicode code point>}
<boolean-literal> :=
	true|false
	
###  Identifiers  ###
Any name must be a valid identifier:
<identifier> :=
	(<a-z>|<A-Z>|_)[(<a-z>|<A-Z>|_|<0-9>)]...
But identifier cannot match any of the keywords.

###  Comments  ###
In any place within the code there can be a comment, which is ignored by the compiler:
<comment> :=
	#<any-symbols>\n
	###<any-symbols>###
